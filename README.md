## 📝 Project Description

This **SSIS ETL project** includes the following steps for data extraction, cleansing, and loading:

1. **🛠️ Extract Data** from **Excel** (Sheets **Học sinh** and **LopHoc**) and load it into **Stage** using the **Incremental Extract** method.
2. **⚙️ Load to Stage**:
   - Cleanse the data, remove old records, and update with new data.
3. **🚀 Load from Stage to NDS**:
   - Load data from **Stage** into **LopHoc_NDS** and **HocSinh** tables in **NDS** after profiling and cleansing the data.
4. **🗂️ Metadata**:
   - Log the ETL timestamps (`LSET`, `CET`) to manage and track data extraction accuracy.
